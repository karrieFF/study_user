# Think-Aloud Protocol Instructions

## What is Think-Aloud?
During this study, we ask you to **think aloud** - that means speaking your thoughts anytime as you interact with the chatbot.

## How to Think Aloud
- **Try to say everything that comes to your mind while you engage with the task** - (1) Describe what you are doing or plan to do, and (2) share any expectations, thoughts, or reactions, even if they seem unrelated to the task.
- **No right thoughts** - Any words are correct - just be honest
- **Speak continuously** - Try to keep talking, even if your thoughts feel unstructured or uncertain - to speak continuously.
- **Be natural** - Talk in your own way of speaking, just like you would if you were thinking aloud or explaining something to a friend.

## Examples of Think-Aloud
- "Hmm… I guess I’d probably start by looking for where is the chatbot."
- "I'm looking for a place to start the conversation..."
- "I expected it to understand that, but it seems confused..."
- "Hmm, I'm not sure what this means..."
- "Oh, that's helpful! It really give me exactly what I needed."

## What NOT to Do
- **Please avoid staying silent for long periods.**
- **You do not need to be perfect** - Image you are alone and speak out anything you want randomly.
- **You do not need to explain or justify your actions** - Just think aloud, don't try to explain or justify your actions.
- **You do not need to plan** - to not try to plan out what to say.
